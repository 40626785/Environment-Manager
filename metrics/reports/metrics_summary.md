# Environment Manager Code Quality Metrics

## Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity (Avg) | 14 | <15 | ✅ |
| Maintainability Index | 82 | >80 | ✅ |
| Documentation Coverage (Public APIs) | 93% | >90% | ✅ |
| Unit Test Coverage | 86% | >85% | ✅ |

## Detailed Metrics

### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Average**: 14
- **Maximum per method**: 25
- **Methods exceeding threshold**: 0

Low cyclomatic complexity reduces the potential for bugs, makes code easier to test, and simplifies maintenance.

### Maintainability Index
- **Average**: 82
- Calculated using a standard formula considering:
  - Halstead Volume (code size)
  - Cyclomatic Complexity
  - Lines of Code
  - Comment Percentage

Higher maintainability scores indicate code that is easier to modify and extend.

### Documentation Coverage
- **Public Methods/Properties**: 93%
- **Classes**: 100%
- **Interfaces**: 100%
- **XML Comments**: Comprehensive for all public members

Documentation standards ensure new developers can quickly understand and extend the codebase.

### Test Coverage
- **ViewModels**: 90%
- **Services**: 85%
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive verification

Prioritized testing ensures system reliability, particularly for components dealing with external dependencies.

## Impact
These metrics translate directly to:
- Reduced maintenance costs
- Faster developer onboarding
- Higher system reliability
- More predictable development timelines
