# Environment Manager Documentation

Welcome to the Environment Manager documentation. This application is a .NET MAUI-based system for comprehensive environment and sensor management across multiple facilities.

## Application Overview

The Environment Manager provides an integrated platform for environmental monitoring, with capabilities for:
- Sensor network management and configuration
- Environmental parameter tracking and analysis
- Maintenance scheduling and prioritization
- Location-based monitoring and reporting

## Architecture Highlights

The application employs a multi-context database architecture that separates concerns into distinct functional areas, improving maintainability and scalability. This architecture allows for independent development and testing of different system components.

## Development Approach

Our team follows these key development principles:

### Architectural Patterns
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation between UI and business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and contexts are injected for better testability

### Coding Standards
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Consistent use of async/await patterns for database and network operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all business logic components
- **Clean Code Practices**: Meaningful naming, appropriate comments, and consistent formatting

### Documentation
- **XML Documentation**: All public APIs are documented
- **UML Diagrams**: Class diagrams and ERDs for major components
- **Feature-Based Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each implemented feature
